# Plug-and-play protein biosensors using aptamer-regulated in vitro transcription

Codes include simulations used to predict reacted reporter kinetics and dose-response curve of IFN-O1-dART, reacted reporter kinetics, and dose-response curves of the comparator.

Eqns S1, S2, are referenced in the Supplementary Information Section 2.1, and Eqn S5 is referenced in Section 2.2.

Eqns S6, S7, S8 are referenced in the Supplementary Information Section 5.2.

Codes were written and run using Jupyter Notebook.
